# EasyExcel
An easy way of accounting for those who don't know Microsoft Excel. 

V1.0: 
*Currently supporting .xlsx and .xls filetypes*

Users have the ability to add multiple entries at a time in the sheet and workbook of their choice. For accounting purposes, the categories are comments/titles, $ amount, date, and the date and which the entry was made.

Whats next in V1.1: 
Currently working on checking if the user has entered a sheet that exists, as well as the ability to create a new sheet of the workbook within EasyExcel. Allowing users more flexibility in the columns (not the predefined one).

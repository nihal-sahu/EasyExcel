# EasyExcel
An easy way of accounting for those who don't know Microsoft Excel. Made with Python 3.9, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Kivy. 

V1.0: 
*Currently supporting .xlsx and .xls filetypes*

Users have the ability to add multiple entries at a time in the sheet and workbook of their choice. For accounting purposes, the categories are comments/titles, $ amount, date, and the date and which the entry was made.

Whats next in V1.1: 
  -Currently working on checking if the user has entered a sheet that exists
  -Creating a new sheet of the workbook within the app
  -Allowing users more flexibility in the columns (allowing them to make more than just the predefined ones). 
  -Using matplotlib to display users data in graphical form to get a realistic perspective on their trends
